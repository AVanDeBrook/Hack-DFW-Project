# Hack-DFW-Project
Project that I made at HackDFW in Dallas.
The goal of this project was to create a program that can dynamically change the brightness of a computer screen depending on the time of day (I realize this is very similar to f.lux, but I had not heard of it when I created this project).

The project was also a stepping stone for me in learning Java so please excuse any bad code, style, or poor programming practices.

I do not plan on developing this project actively or much further than its current state.

Contact me or open an issue if you are interested in the project or want to know more about it.
