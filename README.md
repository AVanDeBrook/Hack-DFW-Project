# Hack-DFW-Project
Project that I made at HackDFW in Dallas.
The goal of this project was to create a program that can dynamically change the brightness of a computer screen depending on the time of day. 

The project was also a stepping stone for me in learning Java so please excuse any bad code, style, or poor programing practices.

I do not plan on developing this project actively or much further than its current state.

Contact me if you are interested in the project or want to know more about it.
